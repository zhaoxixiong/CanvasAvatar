# CanvasAvatar
A simple page that let you get the dataurl from your local image.

Click `upload` and choose an image, then drag and move the circle or the slider to check the preview. Release your finger or mouse to get the dataurl displayed in the textarea below.

Currently, 50% to 150% scale of preview is supported.

An online [demo](https://devchache.github.io/CanvasAvatar/) is avaliable on both mobile and desktop browsers.

Currently, I've tested the performance on Chrome 60 at all platforms.
